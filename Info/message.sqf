<t color='#c80000'>Based on "The Book of The Dude". Please abide.<br />
Down through the ages, this “rebel shrug” has fortified many successful creeds – <br />
Buddhism, Christianity, Sufism, John Lennonism and Fo’-Shizzle-my-Nizzlism and the Jews.<br />
The idea is this: Life is short and complicated and nobody knows what to do about it.<br />
So don’t do anything about it. Just take it easy, man. Stop worrying so much whether<br />
you’ll make it into the finals.<br />
<br />
Kick back with some friends and some oat soda and whether you roll strikes or gutters,<br />
do your best to be true to yourself and others – that is to say, abide.</t><br />
<br />
<t color='#c87b00'>That said, the server logs everything. Please abide.</t><br />
